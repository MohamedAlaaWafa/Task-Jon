            <h2>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h2>
            <p>
                The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to developer a
                skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.

                I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young
                minds about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of
                opportuinities.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="foot2">
            <p>
                As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.

                A qoute I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.

                "How big would you dream, if you knew you would't fail?"
                You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and
                become a leader in something you're passionate about.

                I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.
